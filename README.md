# SceneTextDetection

1) The data we used on consists of around 200 images half - dark text with bright background and half the opposite in the link 
below - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nUXD9dgbnWq071y-uXI35eXGLlkywYzR

2) The code is run by the code.py file then we input the image location and then if text is dark on bright background or the opposite
when prompted

3) We will get the output images with letter wise, line wise and word wise bounding boxes for the image.
